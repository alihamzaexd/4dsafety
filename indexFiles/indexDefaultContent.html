    <h3>What is 4D Safety<span style="vertical-align: super;">&reg;</span></h3>
    <ul>
		<li>4D Safety<sup>&reg; </sup>is a proven approach that focuses on the 4th Dimension of safety performance &ndash;
		safety leadership.
		</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      	<li>4D Safety<sup>&reg; </sup>provides a framework to help safety leaders be more effective.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      	<li>It helps leaders focus on the key leadership practices that have been proven to really drive safety
        performance.
      	</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      	<li>Great leadership creates engaged and committed workers.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      	<li>The outcome is ownership and self-governing work teams who work safely.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h3>4D Safety<span style="vertical-align: super;">&reg;</span> has been designed to:</h3>
    <ul>
      	<li>Allow senior managers to track and monitor the safety leadership in their business.&nbsp; This is done through
        a Dashboard that tracks lead indicators of safety leadership performance at team and individual level.&nbsp;
        This effectively enables managers to be confident that what they expect to happen is actually happening.
      	</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      	<li>The 4D Safety<sup>&reg; </sup>tools also provide measurement and feedback to help individuals target any
        identified areas for development.
      	</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The online tools that are part of the 4D Safety<sup>&reg;</sup> framework include:</p>
    <ul>
      	<li><strong>The Safety Leadership Site Review </strong>&ndash; a review process that achieves two critical
        functions, firstly, to provide guidance and feedback at the individual level and secondly for managers it
        confirms that the expected safety leadership practices are actually happening in their work teams.
      	</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      	<li><strong>The Safety Leadership Practices Self Assessment </strong>&ndash; a self-assessed individual
        development tool.
      	</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      	<li><strong>The Safety Leadership Profile</strong> &ndash; an upward feedback tool that was developed from our
        research of effective leadership practices in over a 1,000 work teams across three companies.
      	</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      	<li><strong>Pre-task Safety Meeting Feedback</strong> &ndash; EARS ON 4 Safety
        <span style="vertical-align: super;">&reg;</span>&nbsp;&ndash; a work team review and development tool used to
        improve the effectiveness of pre-task meetings.
      	</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      	<li><strong>STOP Work Meeting Review </strong>&ndash; a simple<strong> </strong>work team review and development
        tool used to ensure that lessons are learned out of a &ldquo;Stop the Job&rdquo;situation.
      	</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      	<li><strong>Post Task or After Action Review </strong>&ndash; one of the reasons Special Forces perform as well as
        they do is that they are continually learning and tapping into the vast knowledge and experience in their teams.&nbsp;
        With a detailed knowledge of the After Action Review process we have designed a&nbsp;tool to help industry work
        teams create the climate needed for workplace learning.
      	</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      	<li><strong>4D Safety Dashboard</strong> &ndash; the dashboard enables a composite view of the safety leadership
        performance of a team or cohort of leaders in an organisation.
      	</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>A good metaphor for how these tools work is to think of the different views of an onion when cut on different
    angles.&nbsp; Each of these cross sections looks very different; however each of them is a valid picture of what
    the onion looks like from that angle.&nbsp; The message is that one cross section on its own does not provide a
    complete understanding of the whole onion.</p>

    <p>The 4D Safety <span style="vertical-align: super;">&reg;</span>&nbsp;tools are the same in that each of them has
    been specifically designed to provide a different cross sectional view of the team or the individual.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The power of the 4D Safety<span style="vertical-align: super;">&reg;</span>&nbsp;Dashboard is that it enables a
    simple and easily understood composite view of all the different views.</p>
